# Trunk 'Main' based development

Trunk based development is just about the easiest git based workflow there is.
Just build and test a feature and commit/push it to the Main branch.

- Try to prevent long-lived feature branches.
- Every developer can push into the main branch.
- Run tests before you push.
- When you commit use the trello story name in the commit message
- What gets pushed can be released, so be aware of this.
- Of course, you can create a feature branch if you prefer. For example to create a PR for a review.
