# About our foundation

The LITTIL project is an initiative to develop and maintain an Open-Source platform to connect schools with volunteer teachers for
programming workshops. It was born to facilitate the central aim of the Devoxx4Kids foundation, which is to acquaint children with
programming through fun workshops at their school.

The platform provides a web-based portal for schools and volunteer teachers to register themselves and create a public profile. The platform
then facilitates both parties to find possible matches.
