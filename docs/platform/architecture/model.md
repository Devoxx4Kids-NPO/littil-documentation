# Conceptual and data model
The Littil project aims to bring together schools and prospective teachers. To that purpose both parties will be known to the platform with a certain minimum number of properties, i.e. a profile.

Consider the basic scenario of a school looking for a list of suitable and available teachers.

## The teacher profile
We can identify the following minimum properties
* unique identifier, generated by the platform. Preferably a UUID, not a DB sequence number.
* First name
* Surname
* Email (must be unique)
* Postal code, at minimum the digits, not the letters. This is all that is needed for a geographical match.
* Country. At present littil is only active in the Netherlands, but this can change.
* Date of last login/activity. Maintained by the platform, not part of the profile.
* Preferences: for the time being this will be free text. Possibly later you can choose from a set of modules. 
* Availability: which days of the week are you in principle available?  

## The school profile
* unique identifier, generated by the platform
* Name of the school
* Address of the school. Full address is optional. Postal code is mandatory.
* Name of contact person
* Email of contact person
* Date of last login/activity.
