# Conceptual and data model
The Littil project aims to bring together schools and prospective teachers. To that purpose both parties will be known to the platform with a certain minimum number of properties, i.e. a profile.

Consider the basic scenario of a school looking for a list of suitable and available teachers.

## The teacher profile
We can identify the following minimum properties
    * unique identifier, typically an email address or a chose username
    * First name and surname
    * Email
    * Postal code, possibly only the digits, not the letters. This is easiest for a geographical match.
    * Country. At present littil is only active in the Netherlands, but this can change
    * Date of last login/activity.
    * Preferences: a selection of categories, or free text 
    * Availability: days of the week.
