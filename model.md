# Conceptual and data model
The Littil project aims to bring together schools and prospective teachers. To that purpose both parties will be known to the platform with a certain minimum number of properties, i.e. a profile.

Consider the basic scenario of a school looking for a list of suitable and available teachers.

## The teacher profile
We can identify the following minimum properties
* **Essential personal data**
    * unique identifier, typically an email address or a chose username
    * First name and surname
    * Email
    * Place of residence, possibly only postal code. This is necessary to make a geographical match.
    * Country. At present littil is only active in the Netherlands, but this can change
    * Non-essential personal data would be date of birth, gender, telephone, full postal address. It is debatable whether we need at all. The less, the better
    * Nice to have and without obvious privacy constraints would be a link to a public profile, like a personal website or LinkedIn. A few lines of bio would also be good. 
* **Teaching skills, preferences and availability**
  * How experienced is the teacher in giving classes in general? Have they given similar classes before?
  * What is their area of expertise, with regard to the choice of classes they might provide?
  * What weekdays are they available?
  * How far are they willing to travel?
